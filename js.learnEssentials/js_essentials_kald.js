        the user entered from the inital prompt (first line after the beginning of this function)

        Remember we set y=0 earlier? We didn't really need to as
        that is the default. As mentioned before, however, it is best practice.
        This helps us organize before we start calculating things.
        Unlike us, CPUs are usually trained to count from 0 as a valid value.
        They don't normally start with 1 as we do;
        we usually learn to count with our fingers.

        So, we only need to go up to 9 in this while loop from 0 in order to get 10 counts.
        Remember we have set the variable y=0 here.
        IF we had set y=1 earlier, then we would be TELLING the CPU to
        start count from 1 in this calculation. We would then have to use the value of 10
        as the comparitive number (y <= 10) in this while argument if we want to count to 10. */

        If we set it to Boolean(1), it's true. If we set Boolean(true), this is true.
        Pretty much anything else within the () will set Boolean equal to false.
        If we say Boolean(false), it is false. If we leave Boolean empty like Boolean(), this also sets it as false.
        Even if we enter "TRUE" or "True" it is also FALSE as Javascript syntax is also case sensitive.

        using .appendChild(TextHere); passing text strings to that element in the DOM.
